# Numeric Library in Modern C++

## Overview
This project is a numeric library developed in Modern C++ using template programming. It provides a set of core numeric operations that work with arithmetic data types and includes support for a custom data type with operator overloading.

## Features
- **Numeric Operations**: 
  - Returns the maximum value among its arguments.
  - Returns the minimum value among its arguments.
  - Returns the difference between its arguments.
- **Template Programming**:
  - All functions are implemented using C++ templates to support multiple arithmetic data types.


## Usage
The library allows performing numeric operations on various arithmetic types and custom-defined types. It follows Modern C++ best practices and leverages template programming for flexibility.

## Installation & Compilation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile using a C++11 or later compatible compiler.
4. Run the executable to test the implemented functions.
